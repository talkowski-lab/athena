### About the name
This package is named after [Athena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena), the Greek goddess of wisdom, strategy, tactics, and mathematics. She was selected as the namesake for this package given that it relies on understanding the features that influence structural variation mutation rates (_wisdom_), incorporating those features into a statistical model (_mathematics_), and using these models to infer which components of the genome are vulnerable to changes in copy number (a kind of genomic _tactics_/_strategy_).
